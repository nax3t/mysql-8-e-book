In MySQL, a storage engine is a software component that is responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing data in a database. MySQL supports several different storage engines, each with its own characteristics and trade-offs.

Some common storage engines in MySQL are InnoDB, MyISAM, and Memory.

The InnoDB storage engine is a transactional engine that supports transactions, row-level locking, and foreign keys. It is well-suited for applications with heavy read/write workloads and is the default storage engine in MySQL.

The MyISAM storage engine is a non-transactional engine that does not support transactions or foreign keys. It is generally faster for read-only workloads and is well-suited for applications that require fast full-text searches.

The Memory storage engine stores data in memory and is well-suited for temporary tables or tables that are used for caching purposes.

To create a table with a specific storage engine, you can use the ENGINE option in the CREATE TABLE statement. For example, the following CREATE TABLE statement creates a table with the InnoDB storage engine:



`CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1 datatype,
  column2 datatype,
  ...
) ENGINE = InnoDB;` 

You can also change the storage engine of an existing table using the ALTER TABLE statement. For example, the following ALTER TABLE statement changes the storage engine of the 'employees' table to MyISAM:



`ALTER TABLE employees ENGINE = MyISAM;` 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
