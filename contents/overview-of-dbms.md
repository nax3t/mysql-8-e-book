A database management system (DBMS) is a software application that is used to store, retrieve, and manage data in a database. A database is a collection of organized data that is stored in a structured format, such as a table or a set of tables.

A DBMS allows users to create and maintain a database, as well as to perform various operations on the data, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying. It also provides tools for data security, performance optimization, and data integrity.

There are several types of DBMSs, including:

* Relational DBMS (RDBMS): This type of DBMS stores data in tables that are related to each other through relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. Examples include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
    
* Object-oriented DBMS (OODBMS): This type of DBMS stores data in the form of objects and allows users to define relationships between objects. Examples include MongoDB and Cassandra.
    
* Hierarchical DBMS: This type of DBMS stores data in a tree-like structure, with each record having a single parent and potentially multiple children. Examples include IBM's Information Management System (IMS) and Raima's Database Manager (RDM).
    
* Network DBMS: This type of DBMS stores data in a network structure, with multiple many-to-many relationships between records. Examples include Integrated Data Store (IDS) and Integrated Data Dictionary (IDD).
    
* NoSQL DBMS: This type of DBMS is designed to handle large volumes of data that may be unstructured or semi-structured, and is often used in big data and cloud computing applications. Examples include Cassandra, MongoDB, and Couchbase.
