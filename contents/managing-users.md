In MySQL, you can manage users and their access to the database using the GRANT and REVOKE statements.

To create a new user in MySQL, you can use the CREATE USER statement in the following syntax:



`CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';` 

The host parameter specifies the host from which the user can connect to the database. You can use the '%' wildcard to allow the user to connect from any host.

To grant a user access to a database or specific table, you can use the GRANT statement in the following syntax:



`GRANT privilege_list
ON database_name.table_name
TO 'username'@'host';` 

The privilege_list specifies the privileges that the user will have on the database or table. Some common privileges are SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and CREATE.

For example, the following GRANT statement grants the user 'jane'@'%' the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE privileges on the 'employees' table of the 'company' database:



`GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
ON company.employees
TO 'jane'@'%';` 

To revoke a user's access to a database or specific table, you can use the REVOKE statement in the following syntax:



`REVOKE privilege_list
ON database_name.table_name
FROM 'username'@'host';` 

For example, the following REVOKE statement revokes the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE privileges on the 'employees' table of the 'company' database from the user 'jane'@'%':



`REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
ON company.employees
FROM 'jane'@'%';` 

It is important to note that you must have the GRANT OPTION privilege and the appropriate privileges on the database or table in order to grant or revoke privileges to other users.
