Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that is used to manage and manipulate data in a database. SQL is designed specifically for working with relational databases, which are databases that store data in the form of tables that are related to each other through relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

Some of the key features of SQL include:

* Data definition: SQL includes commands for creating and modifying database structures, such as tables, indexes, and constraints.
    
* Data manipulation: SQL includes commands for inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data in a database.
    
* Data control: SQL includes commands for managing access to data, such as granting and revoking permissions.
    
* Data integrity: SQL includes features such as constraints and triggers that can help to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data in a database.
    

SQL is a standard language that is used by many different database management systems (DBMSs), including MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. It is a powerful and flexible language that is widely used for managing and manipulating data in a wide range of applications.
