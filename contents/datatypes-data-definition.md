In MySQL 8, data types are used to specify the type of data that a column in a database table can store. Different data types are suitable for different kinds of data, and choosing the right data type can help to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of your database.

MySQL 8 supports a wide range of data types, including:

* Numeric data types: These data types can store numeric values such as integers and floating-point numbers. Examples include INT, FLOAT, and DECIMAL.
    
* String data types: These data types can store character strings, such as names and addresses. Examples include CHAR, VARCHAR, and TEXT.
    
* Date and time data types: These data types can store date and time values. Examples include DATE, TIME, and DATETIME.
    
* Boolean data types: These data types can store Boolean values (true or false). The BOOLEAN data type is not supported in MySQL 8, but you can use the TINYINT(1) data type instead.
    
* JSON data types: MySQL 8 includes support for storing and querying JSON data using the JSON data type and related functions.
    

To define the data type for a column in a MySQL 8 table, you can use the following syntax:



`column_name DATA_TYPE [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT default_value] [COMMENT 'comment']` 

For example, to define an INT column named "id" that cannot be NULL and has a default value of 0, you could use the following syntax:



`id INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` 

In addition to defining the data type for a column, you can also use SQL commands to define other aspects of the structure of a database table, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes. These definitions can help to ensure the integrity and efficiency of your data.
